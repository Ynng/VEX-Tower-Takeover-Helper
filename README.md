An app for tracking the scores of VRC's 2019-2020 game: Tower Takeover

Improvements over the official "VRC Hub" app:
* Bigger buttons, brighter colors, can be used while keeping your eyes on the field
* Highlights score difference instead of the score
* Tower suggestions: suggest a color of cube to put into/remove from a tower for maximum increase in points difference

Missing features:
* Timer
* 6 points auton bonus

Kinda jank stuff:
* Swipe left 10 times to swap friendly/enemy team
* Swipe right 10 times to swap red/blue
* All cube counts gets reset back to 0 after a color/team swap, but this change wouldn't be reflected in the HTML until you interact with each cube once.
  * The rectangle with rounded corners is the fiendly team.
